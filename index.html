    <h1>Croissant</h1>

    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a
      layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and
      folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
      technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made
      since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.

      Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French
      bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early
      20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
      pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that can be
      freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
      Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,
      and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
      patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
